(oops) object oriented programming  is a programming appproach that are based on 
classes and objects.which contain variables and functions that manipulate the data.

we create class to  store the different information of objects
and in single class we can store multiple information.

Attributes are variable inside the class.

class is a templete in which we store the information of objects.
No memory allocation for class 

class is a user defined data type or blueprint that wrapped data and function into 
single entity

variables and function are stored in single entity are called class and we need object to access 

semicolon is inportant in closing the body of class

object information are defined in class

object is the concrete representation of the blueprint that defined by the class

object have two properties  State(data) and Behaviour(Function)

Attributes in class are private by default

function inside the class must be public so it can be access  outside the class  by the main function through objects
